# ADR-011: KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-16  
**Authors**: Piotr Brzozowski  
**Reviewers**: Development Team

## Context

As the Entirius platform grows in complexity with its modular monolith architecture, there is a constant need to balance feature richness with maintainability. The development team has observed instances where solutions have become unnecessarily complex, leading to:

- Increased development time for new features
- Higher maintenance costs
- Steeper learning curve for new team members
- More bugs and edge cases
- Reduced system reliability

The KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a design philosophy that emphasizes simplicity in design and implementation. This principle is particularly relevant for Entirius as it helps maintain code quality while scaling the platform.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Strict KISS Implementation
- **Description**: Enforce rigorous simplicity standards across all code, rejecting any solution that isn't the simplest possible
- **Pros**: 
  - Maximum code simplicity
  - Fastest development cycles
  - Easiest debugging and maintenance
- **Cons**:
  - May limit architectural flexibility
  - Could lead to oversimplified solutions that don't meet complex requirements
  - Might require frequent refactoring as needs evolve
- **Impact on system**: Significant refactoring of existing complex components

### Option 2: Balanced KISS Approach
- **Description**: Apply KISS principle as a guiding philosophy while allowing complexity when justified by business requirements
- **Pros**: 
  - Maintains simplicity as default approach
  - Allows for necessary complexity when requirements demand it
  - Promotes thoughtful design decisions
  - Balances maintainability with functionality
- **Cons**:
  - Requires judgment calls on when complexity is justified
  - May lead to inconsistent application across teams
- **Impact on system**: Gradual simplification of existing code where possible

### Option 3: Guidelines-Only Approach
- **Description**: Establish KISS as a recommended practice without enforcement mechanisms
- **Pros**: 
  - No disruption to existing development workflows
  - Flexible application based on developer judgment
- **Cons**:
  - May not effectively address existing complexity issues
  - Inconsistent adoption across the team
  - Limited impact on code quality improvement
- **Impact on system**: Minimal changes to existing architecture

## Decision

**Chosen option**: Balanced KISS Approach

**Rationale**: 
The balanced approach aligns with Entirius's modular monolith architecture and provides practical guidelines that can be applied consistently across the platform. This option:
- Maintains development velocity while improving code quality
- Respects the complexity requirements of e-commerce and AI features
- Provides clear criteria for when complexity is justified
- Supports the long-term maintainability goals of the platform
- Integrates well with existing development practices and ADRs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Faster onboarding for new developers
- Reduced debugging time and fewer bugs
- Better system reliability and performance
- Lower long-term maintenance costs
- Enhanced team productivity

### Negative
- Initial time investment required for team training
- Some existing complex code may need refactoring
- Potential resistance to changing established patterns
- Need for ongoing code review focus on simplicity

### Neutral
- Development practices will evolve gradually
- Code review processes will include simplicity evaluation
- Documentation standards will emphasize clear explanations
