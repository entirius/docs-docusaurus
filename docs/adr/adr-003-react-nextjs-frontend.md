# ADR-003: Next.js for Frontend Applications

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-23  
**Authors**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: Piotr Brzozowski 

## Context

Entirius e-commerce platform requires a modern frontend framework for both the customer-facing application and the administrative panel. The solution needs to:
- Provide excellent user experience for e-commerce customers
- Support server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- Enable rapid development of administrative interfaces
- Integrate seamlessly with Django REST API backend ([ADR-002](./adr-002-openapi-django-rest-framework))
- Support modern development practices and tooling
- Scale with the modular monolith architecture ([ADR-001](./adr-001-modular-monolith))

Key technical requirements:
- TypeScript support for type safety
- SEO-friendly rendering for e-commerce content
- Mobile-responsive design capabilities
- State management for complex UI interactions
- Component reusability between customer and admin interfaces
- Performance optimization for e-commerce workloads
- Integration with OpenAPI-generated client SDKs

## Considered Options

### Option 1: React with Next.js
- **Description**: Use React library with Next.js framework for both frontend and admin panel
- **Pros**: 
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for SEO
  - Full-stack capabilities with API routes
  - Excellent TypeScript integration
  - Large ecosystem and community support
  - Built-in performance optimizations
  - File-based routing system
  - Image optimization and lazy loading
  - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
  - Easy deployment and hosting options
- **Cons**:
  - Learning curve for Next.js-specific features
  - Can be complex for simple applications
  - Bundle size considerations
  - React-specific patterns and lifecycle
- **Impact on system**: Provides modern, performant frontend with excellent SEO capabilities

### Option 2: Vue.js with Nuxt.js
- **Description**: Use Vue.js framework with Nuxt.js for universal application development
- **Pros**: 
  - Gentle learning curve and intuitive syntax
  - Excellent documentation and developer experience
  - Built-in state management with Vuex/Pinia
  - Server-side rendering with Nuxt.js
  - Smaller bundle sizes compared to React
  - Strong TypeScript support
  - Composition API for better code organization
- **Cons**:
  - Smaller ecosystem compared to React
  - Less job market availability
  - Fewer third-party component libraries
  - Less integration with enterprise tools
  - Smaller community for e-commerce specific solutions
- **Impact on system**: Clean, maintainable frontend with good performance

### Option 3: Angular
- **Description**: Use Angular framework for enterprise-grade application development
- **Pros**: 
  - Full framework with opinionated structure
  - Excellent TypeScript integration (built-in)
  - Powerful CLI and development tools
  - Built-in dependency injection
  - Strong testing framework
  - Enterprise-ready architecture patterns
- **Cons**:
  - Steep learning curve
  - Heavy framework overhead
  - Complex for simple use cases
  - Verbose syntax and boilerplate
  - Less suitable for content-heavy e-commerce sites
  - Limited SSR capabilities compared to Next.js
- **Impact on system**: Robust but potentially over-engineered for e-commerce needs

## Decision

**Chosen option**: React with Next.js

**Rationale**: 
React with Next.js is the optimal choice for Entirius frontend because:

- **SEO optimization**: Next.js SSR/SSG capabilities are crucial for e-commerce visibility
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and code splitting
- **Developer experience**: Excellent tooling, hot reloading, and debugging capabilities
- **Ecosystem maturity**: Vast library of React components and e-commerce solutions
- **TypeScript integration**: First-class TypeScript support for type-safe development
- **API integration**: Seamless integration with OpenAPI-generated clients from Django backend
- **Scalability**: Component architecture scales well with modular monolith approach
- **Team expertise**: React skills are widely available and transferable
- **Community support**: Large community with e-commerce specific solutions and patterns
- **Hosting flexibility**: Multiple deployment options from static to serverless

## Consequences

### Positive
- **SEO-friendly e-commerce** - Server-side rendering improves search engine visibility
- **Performance optimization** - Built-in optimizations for Core Web Vitals
- **Developer productivity** - Rich ecosystem and tooling accelerate development
- **Code reusability** - Shared components between customer and admin interfaces
- **Type safety** - TypeScript integration reduces runtime errors
- **Modern development** - Latest React features and best practices
- **Flexible deployment** - Multiple hosting options from static to serverless

### Negative
- **Framework complexity** - Next.js introduces additional concepts beyond React
- **Bundle size** - React applications can be larger than Vue alternatives
- **Learning investment** - Team needs to learn Next.js specific patterns
- **Build complexity** - More sophisticated build process compared to simple React

### Neutral
- **JavaScript ecosystem** - Reinforces JavaScript/TypeScript choice across stack
- **Component architecture** - Encourages thinking in reusable UI components

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Project Setup**
   - Initialize Next.js projects for frontend and admin panel
   - Configure TypeScript and ESLint
   - Set up integration with Django API
   - Implement basic routing structure

2. **Phase 2: Core Components**
   - Create shared UI component library
   - Implement authentication flows
   - Build customer-facing e-commerce pages
   - Develop admin panel basic structure

3. **Phase 3: Integration & Optimization**
   - Integrate with OpenAPI client SDKs
   - Implement state management (React Context/Redux)
   - Add SEO optimization and meta tags
   - Performance testing and optimization

4. **Phase 4: Production Readiness**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and error tracking
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Deploy to production environment

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals scores > 90 for all pages
- **SEO**: Search engine crawling and indexing of all product pages
- **Development velocity**: Feature development time < 2 days for standard pages
- **Code quality**: TypeScript coverage > 95% with zero type errors
- **User experience**: Mobile responsiveness across all devices
- **API integration**: 100% coverage of backend API endpoints
