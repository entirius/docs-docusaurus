# ADR-006: Docusaurus for Technical Documentation

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Authors**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: Piotr Brzozowski

## Context

Entirius requires a comprehensive technical documentation platform that can serve multiple purposes:
- Developer documentation for APIs and architecture
- User guides and tutorials
- Project documentation accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Key requirements:
- **Modern and maintainable**: Documentation should be easy to write and maintain
- **Developer-friendly**: Support for Markdown, code highlighting, and version control
- **Scalable**: Ability to handle growing documentation needs
- **Multi-format support**: Blog posts, documentation pages, and structured content
- **Integration capabilities**: Work well with existing development workflow

Current challenges:
- Need for centralized documentation that replaces scattered README files
- Requirement for professional presentation for open-source community
- Integration with existing GitHub-based development workflow

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Docusaurus
- **Description**: React-based static site generator specifically designed for documentation, developed by Meta
- **Pros**:

  - MDX support for interactive documentation
  - Built-in versioning and internationalization
- **Cons**:
  - Requires Node.js knowledge for customization
  - May be overkill for simple documentation needs
