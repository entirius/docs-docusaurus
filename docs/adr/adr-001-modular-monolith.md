# ADR-001: Modular Monolith Architecture

## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-17  
**Authors**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: Piotr Brzozowski 

## Context

Entirius is an e-commerce AI platform in early development phase. We need to choose the primary architectural pattern that will guide the system design and implementation. The decision impacts deployment strategy, development complexity, operational overhead, and future scalability options.

Key considerations:
- Early-stage project with evolving requirements
- Small development team
- Need for rapid prototyping and iteration
- Future scalability requirements unknown
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Python 3 as primary programming language

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Microservices Architecture
- **Description**: Decompose the system into small, independent services communicating via APIs
- **Pros**: 
  - Independent scaling of components
  - Technology diversity possible
  - Team autonomy for different services
  - Fault isolation
- **Cons**:
  - High operational complexity
  - Network latency and reliability issues
  - Distributed system challenges (debugging, monitoring)
  - Overhead for small team
  - Complex deployment pipeline
- **Impact on system**: Requires sophisticated infrastructure, monitoring, and deployment tools

### Option 2: Traditional Monolith
- **Description**: Single codebase with all functionality in one deployable unit
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple deployment and operations
  - Easy debugging and testing
  - Strong consistency guarantees
  - Low operational overhead
- **Cons**:
  - Tight coupling between components
  - Difficult to scale individual parts
  - Technology lock-in
  - Risk of becoming unmaintainable
- **Impact on system**: Risk of creating a "big ball of mud" architecture

### Option 3: Modular Monolith
- **Description**: Single deployable unit with well-defined internal modules and clear boundaries
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple deployment like traditional monolith
  - Clear module boundaries and separation of concerns
  - Easy refactoring and testing
  - Can evolve to microservices if needed
  - Lower operational complexity
  - Strong consistency within modules
- **Cons**:
  - Requires discipline to maintain module boundaries
  - All modules share same technology stack
  - Entire application scales as unit
- **Impact on system**: Enables clean architecture with option to extract services later

## Decision

**Chosen option**: Modular Monolith

**Rationale**: 
Modular Monolith is the best fit for Entirius at this stage because:

- **Development velocity**: Enables rapid development and iteration without microservices overhead
- **Operational simplicity**: Single deployment unit reduces operational complexity for small team
- **Architectural discipline**: Forces good modular design without distributed system complexity
- **Future flexibility**: Can extract modules to microservices when business requirements justify the complexity
- **Team size**: Optimal for single developer/small team scenario
- **Technology consistency**: Leverages Python/PostgreSQL expertise without forcing premature technology decisions
- **Testing simplicity**: Easier integration testing without network boundaries

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster development cycles** - No service boundaries to cross during development
- **Simplified operations** - Single deployment, monitoring, and debugging target
- **Better performance** - In-memory communication between modules
- **Easier testing** - Integration tests don't require complex test environments
- **Clear evolution path** - Can extract services when complexity justifies it
- **Lower infrastructure costs** - Single application instance to start

### Negative
- **Scaling limitations** - Cannot scale individual modules independently
- **Technology constraints** - All modules must use same tech stack initially
- **Deployment coupling** - All modules deploy together
- **Potential for tight coupling** - Requires discipline to maintain boundaries

### Neutral
- **Team structure** - Works well with current single developer, may need adjustment as team grows
- **Database strategy** - Single database fits well with monolith approach

*This ADR establishes the foundational architectural pattern for Entirius. 
Future architectural decisions should align with this modular monolith approach until business requirements justify a different pattern.*
