# Business Scenarios

Business scenarios are requirements that clearly communicate main goals - understandable by everyone within seconds. We use them to describe background of every version and feature in documentation.

## User Roles

We use 3 main roles:

- **Tech Lead** - responsible for the technical site, interacts with platform via CMS and Console
- **Business Owner** - responsible for the business site, interacts with platform via CMS
- **Customer** - end customer who converts (buys, fills out lead form), interacts with PWA Front End

We keep scenarios specific and concise - 1 sentence maximum, 2-3 sentences only when necessary.

**Fixtures Definition:** Configurable settings that shouldn't be touched thoughtlessly.

## Examples

- As a Tech Lead, I can configure the Entirius system through interaction with the claude-code agent or another designated agent.
- As **Customer** I can find products using search
- As **Customer** I can find the right products using search even when making typos
- As **Business Owner** I can create new customer profile using Admin Panel in CMS
